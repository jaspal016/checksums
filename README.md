# File Checksums

Windows batch script to generate checksums of all the files in current directory. Useful for detecting duplicate files in case of multiple copies

Simply download checksums.bat and copy it to any folder with multiple files present. This script will create a file named **01 checksums.txt** and will redirect all its output there. The file will be replaced if it already exists.
